Palm Tree models are originally from a royalty free model pack by killst4r, available on Turbosquid: https://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/490485
After including them, they were modified by Arnooby, who said that I can use his modified version. They are available free at: https://github.com/Arnooby/Models_unity_free/

They are included for demonstration purposes only; I picked them only because they were free, fairly nice looking, and covered by a relatively permissive license. That being said, I have no affiliation with the artist, and they are not covered by the same MIT license.
In order to somewhat cover my butt in the very unlikely event that the author decides my inclusion of these assets constitutes "distribution," if you want to use these assets yourself, I ask that you at least visit the Turbosquid page and leave a nice rating/review.
